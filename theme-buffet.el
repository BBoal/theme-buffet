;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Theme-Buffet lets the user specify different time periods of the day and for
;; each period, a list of preferred themes to be randomly loaded accordingly.
;; To install you just have to clone the repo from the url, add the path to the
;; 'load-path variable and then require the library.  Here's an example, for
;; those who still love the Emacs 28 or earlier way of doing things:
;;
;;    # In the terminal
;;    git clone https://git.sr.ht/~bboal/theme-buffet ~/.emacs.d/theme-buffet
;;
;;    ;; In Emacs, evaluate
;;    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/theme-buffet")
;;    (require 'theme-buffet)
;;
;; The newest way, from Emacs 29 onward:
;;
;;    (package-vc-install "https://git.sr.ht/~bboal/theme-buffet")
;;
;; There are two templates preconfigured available for usage.  One enabled by
;; default, with the standard themes that come with vanilla Emacs; the other
;; more fancier, can be easily enabled by evaluating the following:
;;
;;	  (setq theme-buffet-menu 'modus-ef)
;;
;; The binding above will set the themes to be either Modus or Ef, authored by
;; Protesilaos Stavrou <https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos>, distributed across six
;; periods of the day (night, twilight, morning, day, afternoon and evening).
;; The library will not require the aforementioned package, you will have to
;; install it manual if you intent to use it.  Finally to start using
;; Theme-Buffet, evaluate:
;;
;;    (theme-buffet-mode 1)
;;
;; Following the appanage way of Emacs, both the names and number of themes and
;; time periods can be freely changed while mantaining the same structure.
;; There is also a time-offset that can be set by the user to match a specific
;; time-zone/personal preference.  E.g
;;
;;    (setq theme-buffet-time-offset 2)
;;
;; All this can be achieved by tweaking `theme-buffet-end-user'.  For
;; inspiration, take a look at `theme-buffet--modus-ef' which is used when
;; setting `theme-buffet-menu' to 'modus-ef like demonstrated above.
;;
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; There are several interactive functions available to the user serving as
;; entry points to the package.
;;
;; To set the menu for the desired themes property list and have the themes
;; change when the periods do: `theme-buffet-built-in',
;; `theme-buffet-modus-ef' and `theme-buffet-end-user'.
;;
;; To set the timer for a certain time interval of hours or minutes:
;;`theme-buffet-timer-hours' or `theme-buffet-timer-mins'.
;;
;; To load a theme from the current period: `theme-buffet-a-la-carte'.  If
;; instead you want to load a random theme from a prompted period, there's
;; `theme-buffet-order-other-period'.  To load an existing random theme use
;; `theme-buffet-anything-goes'.
;;
;; Some examples in lisp:
;;
;;    (theme-buffet-modus-ef) ; to set the theme plist to Modus and Ef
;;    (theme-buffet-timer-mins 30) ; to change theme every 30m from now
;;    (theme-buffet-timer-hours 2) ; to also change every 2h from now
;;
;; Interactively, as an example, you would press M-x
;; `theme-buffet-order-other-period'.  Then, after choosing any defined period,
;; you would get returned a random loaded theme from the aforementioned period.

;;
;; Disclaimer from Bruno Boal to the reader: This package was produced during my
;; learning sessions with Protesilaos "Prot" Stavrou and improved as homework.
;; Most of the credit goes to him, the mistakes you may find are my own.
;; Personally, despite the disadvantages and advantages of not being a
;; professional programmer, it is essential for me to always have fun and
;; enjoyment during learning and programming.  In this respect, mission
;; accomplished, a big "thank you!" to my mentor.  Also, keep in mind at least
;; two things - the fact that this package, like many others before it, has its
;; genesis in a collective effort, with didatic purposes and personal use in
;; mind, but also that future improvements could and should come from people
;; like you, a user of free software.
;;
;; Happy hacking!
